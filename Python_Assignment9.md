7. What happens if an existing file is opened in write mode?
8. How do you tell the difference between read() and readlines()?
9. What data structure does a shelf value resemble?

#1 Relative path refers to the path of file from our current location

#2 Absolute path in operatings system refers to the path that contains all the information that is needed to locate a file.

#3 os.getcwd() gives us the current working directory of our environment whereas os.chdir() is used to change our current directory to some other directory.

#4 . indicates that the file is in the current directory and .. indicates that the file is in the parent directory where the current directory is located

#5 In C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt, the dir name is the part 'In C:\bacon\eggs\' and the base name is the part 'spam.txt' 

#6 Three modes that can be passed to open() function is 'w','r','a' which are write,read and append respectively

#7 If there's an existing file then opening it in write mode simply open that particular file rather than creating a new file and opening that in write mode.

#8 read() will read the contents of the file as a single string whereas readline() will read the contents of the file as list of strings over which you can loop by using a for loop.

#9 shelf resemble stack data structure


```python
